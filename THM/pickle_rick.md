# Pickle Rick

At the end of the **Web Hacking Fundamentals** module in TryHackMe you are tasked with a challenge to put together all that you've learnt in the module. I was a little apprehensive as it had taken me a few months to go through the content with my busy schedule. I want to say that I really enjoyed this challenge as was a bit of fun, not too complex but just enough to take me about an hour and a half to complete. 

## Walkthrough

### Enumeration

The first phase in any web testing is recon and enumeration. We want to know what is present on the IP provided. We assume that we'll get atleast a port 80 for HTTP on the IP in a port scan using **nmap**. We'll then need to do some recon on the web site.
