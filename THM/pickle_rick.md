# Pickle Rick

At the end of the **Web Hacking Fundamentals** module in TryHackMe you are tasked with a challenge to put together all that you've learnt in the module. I was a little apprehensive as it had taken me a few months to go through the content with my busy schedule. I want to say that I really enjoyed this challenge as was a bit of fun, not too complex but just enough to take me about an hour and a half to complete. 

## Walkthrough

The first phase in any web testing is recon and enumeration. We want to know what is present on the IP provided. We assume that we'll get atleast a port 80 for HTTP on the IP in a port scan using **nmap**. We'll then need to do some recon on the web site.

So, I do an `nmap` scan.

<p>

</p>

Our results show that we have both port 22 and 80 open. Port 22 is for SSH and there isn't much we can do there. I attempted an anonymous login but was refused. We also do not have enough information at this stage. As you can see, running `-sV -sC` (service scan and default scripts) gives us a little more information. We can see that a web server is running (Apache 2.4.18), our target is a Linux system (Ubuntu) and that the http-title returns, "Rick is sup4r cool". 

Next I navigate to the page and find a static webpage with not much to go off. I then inspect the web page and this reveals some leaked data. We observe that a comment has been left in the HTML saying, "Note to self, remember username! Username: R1ckRul3s". Definetely something to take note of later.

</p>

This information indicates that there must be a login page somewhere. At this point I try using this username to login to SSH but this fails. I then think of running gobuster but this only leads me to the `/assets` directory which doesn't hold much.

<p>

</p>

I then remember that nmap has a script that does http enumeration. I run this and find a couple of pages. It is at this point that I remember that gobuster has the `-x` flag to denote file types that it can search for. HTTP-enum script gives us both 'login.php' and 'robots.txt'.

<p>

</p>

I then navigate to the 'robots.txt' file and find the following.

<p>

</p>

Hmmm... no idea what that's about. If you've seen the show you know that that is what Rick says but there's indication of its significance. 

I then go to the 'login.php' page. And it redirects me to 'portal.php'. As implied, we are at a login page. I put in the username and then spend some time thinking about the password. Then I think to myself, what a wonderful world. (nah!) I think maybe I can use the text in 'robots.txt' as a password?

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7i5aPGR.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

And BOOM! we're in!!! We are presented with a page that has a 'Command Panel', a dialogue box and an 'Execute' button.

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I4UhiDj.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

I also investigate the rest of the links at the top of the page, but they all have message saying only the real Rick can access them.

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bF1Etwd.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

Back at the 'Command Panel' I used the command `whoami` and I get `www-data` as the user that is running commands. 

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HoDwvE2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

I then run `ls` to list the files in the directory that I am in. Generally, when you're logged in as www-data your home directory is /var/www/html. The contents of the directory are listed below.

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F9V2lSX.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

And we have our first flag. So I enter `cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt` but I get an error return. I am not allowed to run this command. I think for a while and try the `more` and `head` commands but these don't work either. I then use `less` and it prints it!

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/d5VgwGB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

I then search around the directories for a while (like 30 minutes I think). Eventually I search the /home directory and discover two users: rick and ubuntu. I search both directories. I then find in Rick's home directory the second ingredient! Another flag!!

<p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AmJuH4c.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

Since I found this flag in Rick's home directory I assume that the next flag must be in the root user's home directory. I assume that www-data doesn't have access to that directory but I try any way. I get nothing back when I enter `ls /root`. This could be there's nothing there or because I'm not allowed to view the contents of the directory. I decide to try `sudo`. It works!! Apparently, www-data is allowed to use `sudo` without authentication. So I run `sudo ls /root`.

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ayYr9aC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

And then `sudo less /root/3rd.txt`.

<p>

</p>

And with that the challenge was complete. In this challenge we have a few insecure things. Firstly, we have leaked credentials in the HTML and robots.txt file present on the public side of the site. As we have seen, a threat actor could abuse this to get past the admin panel of the site. 

The next problem is that the site also has an unsanitized dialogue box from which you can traverse the file system of the server. Sure, the `cat` command was locked down, but a user should not, without proper authentication, be able to have access to the whole file system. 

Finally, www-data had too many privileges for a user account created for the web server service. The system administrator should've locked down that account and disallowed `sudo` privileges or atleast made sure that it could only run commands necesarry for the site and not over the whole system. Proper authentication could've stopped an attacker from executing commands on the server.


## Further Research

After I completed the room I went on YouTube and watched [**John Hammondâ€™s** solution to the challenge](https://youtu.be/oCAtfcr3iUw). I really enjoyed watching him work through it differently. I was impressed by the fact that he made a reverse shell in the command dialogue box. I tried it out myself and was kicking myself to how easy it was moving around the file system like that. 

So, back to when I first logged in to `login.php` we go need to execute a command using python3 (as python 2 does not run on the server). We also need to set up a listener on our local machine.

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h7pVrmq.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt=""/>
</p>

Then we use [PentestMonkey's](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet#:~:text=shell%20here.-,Python,-This%20was%20tested) reverse shell script. We'll need to modify it to have our IP address and port number. We also need to make sure that we run it using python3 and not just python. Copy and paste it into the dialogue box on the webpage. Click 'Execute' and the page should just hang.

</p>

<p>

</p>

Checking our listener we see that we are connected.

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2HoCDgM.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=""/>
</p>

I then run `whoami` and see that I am www-data. Now that we know we can run any command with `sudo` I run `sudo su` which makes me the superuser/root. Trying `whoami` agains gives me `root`.

I then go to the /root and `cat 3rd.txt`
